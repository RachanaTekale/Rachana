         <ul>
             <li>Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.</li>
              <li>Get busy living or get busy dying.</li>
               <li>You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.</li>
                <li>Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.</li>
                 <li>If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.</li>
                  <li>Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.</li>
                   <li>Money and success don’t change people; they merely amplify what is already there.</li>

             </ul>
